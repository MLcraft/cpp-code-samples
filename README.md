The solo assignments folder contains assignments from 2 different courses.

- For the solo game assignment, the code around the given TODO comments is my code.

- For the solo algorithm assignments, any function without a "given" comment is my work.<br /><br />

For the group game project, I have included a few files which contain major contributions from me.

I wrote the following functionality:
- saving, reloading, and map rendering
- mouse drag functionality to allow for entities to be moved using mouse grab during a specific quest
- keyboard controls for saving and restarting/reloading
- adding sound effects played during collision of specific entities

Here are some line number highlights for code which I wrote in world.cpp: <br />
- 347-1123, 1536-1630, 1862-1914, 2018-2050
